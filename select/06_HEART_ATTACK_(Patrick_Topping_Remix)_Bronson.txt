I've been patient
But I won't follow
'Cause I don't wanna be your friend
What does it matter in the end?
I want a little bit of lightnin'
No, I don't wanna be your friend
'Cause these feelings are a violence

This love's a heart attack

This love's a heart attack

This love's a heart attack

See, I've been patient
But I won't follow
'Cause I don't wanna be your friend
What does it matter if it ends?
I want a little bit of lightnin'
No, I don't wanna be your friend

I want a little bit of lightnin'
No, I don't wanna be your friend
I want a little bit of lightenin'
What does it matter if it ends?
But I don't wanna live in silence
What does it matter in the end?

I want a little bit of lightnin'
No, I don't wanna be your friend
Because these feelings are a violence
What does it matter in the end?

This love's a heart attack
This love's a heart attack
This love's a heart attack
This love's a heart attack

This love's a heart attack

No, I won't go back

This love's a heart attack

This love's a heart attack

What does it matter anyway?
(What does it matter in the end?)
What does it matter anyway?
(What does it matter in the end?)

Thirsting from noon
Herbalist fumes
Where's me balloon?
Where's me balloon?
Where's me balloon?
Where's me balloon?
Balloon

Been in the lab too long, man
I'd have it to, doo wop jazz
Who's got the bag?
Tooting on the Boris
Smoking on the Rishi
Shooting with my hand cocked
(Got the bag)

Who's got the bag?

Food in the back pocket
I'm here to boo Babylon
Let's be having the boondocks back
You have to do what you can
Tooting the Boris
Smoking on the Rishi
Shooting with my hand cocked
(Got the)

Go back to doing what slaps
It's a matter of duty, damn
Fuck the jukebox in the cafe
Good God
